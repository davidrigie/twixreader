## Before you install

It is recommended that you start with the anaconda or miniconda python distribution:


https://conda.io/miniconda.html

Then you need to have numpy installed:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

## Install

To install run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

or using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

This is still in very early development, beware!
